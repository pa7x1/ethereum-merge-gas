# Readme

The scripts contained in this directory contain all the code used for the statistical analysis and plotting the graphs.

In `./proof_of_stake/` you have the scripts ready to use a JSON file containing all the Proof of Stake blocks and in the
`./proof_of_work` ready to use a JSON file containing all the Proof of Work blocks. The files are identical and simply use 
a different file. This is for the convenience of the user so everything is as reproducible as possible.

The data necessary can be obtained using the code found in the `data` folder, check its `README.md`.
